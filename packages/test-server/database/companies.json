The CEO received $42.9 million in total compensation, mostly in stock awards, in the 2019 fiscal year that ended on June 30, according to Microsoft’s annual proxy statement, which came out on Wednesday. The figure is up 66% from the prior fiscal year but lower than the $84.3 million Nadella received in the 2014 fiscal year, when he took over from Steve Ballmer.",

The software giant unveiled a similar console last year with Taco Bell’s signature “ring” when it’s powered on — and this console has the same ring — but this year Microsoft is bundling in the new Xbox Elite 2 controller, too. Xbox fans will need to purchase Taco Bell’s Double Chalupa Box to try and win this special bundle, dubbed the Xbox One X Eclipse Limited Edition. The promotion starts today, meaning if you’re a lucky winner then you’ll be able to get an Elite 2 controller well before its release on November 4th, and without the $179.99 price tag.",

As Microsoft Azure CTO Mark Russinovich  told me ahead of today’s launch, OAM very much solves a problem that a lot of developers and ops teams are facing every day. “If you take a look just at the Kubernetes ecosystem, Kubernetes  has no concept of an application,” he explained.",

While it’ll work wirelessly while playing Stadia on a Chromecast Ultra, you’ll have to plug in a USB-C cable to use it with computers or phones at launch, Google tells The Verge.         When Google first showed off the controller in March, the company touted how you could seamlessly switch from gaming on your TV to a laptop or phone while using the same exact controller, without having to pair it to each device — because the controller would stay directly connected to Stadia’s servers over its own Wi-Fi.",

Google hasn’t responded to The Verge’s request for comment to confirm. The idea for Clips was an intriguing one: it was a tiny AI-powered wide angle camera designed to automatically capture short videos of precious moments with your loved ones. In theory, by setting up a Clips camera in your house, you wouldn’t have to worry about quick-drawing your phone to record your baby’s first steps.",

Devices like the Pixelbook and Pixel Slate have pushed the $1,000 price point in an attempt to demonstrate Chrome OS’s viability in a more premium tier. With the Pixelbook Go, on the other hand, Google’s playing much more to the cloud-based operating system’s strengths, with a far more accessible price point.",

Apple's phones captured better videos, but between the P30 Pro's quad-camera setup and features that include 5x optical zoom, Huawei (and Google) had topped Apple as an industry leader in still photography.

Facebook had a stated policy of not running deceptive ads, but changed it right before the ad ran – just for politicians’ messages. Warren took aim at the practice by headlining her own Facebook ad with the cheeky claim that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had just endorsed Trump, arguing that choosing to profit from lies amounts to an endorsement of a particular kind of candidate.",
